# The Sketch of the ***SafeCity London*** Website

The initial idea was to create a website representing crime information of different boroughs in London, based on the latest official crime data from Police.uk Data.

It was expected to provide an interactive and visualised platform for existing and potential Londoners to avoid crime hotspots.

The website was expected to contain some interactive maps and customised crime data line charts so that users could intuitively access the information.

##  The Home Page

From the initial design, there would be four main pages with a navigation bar at the top: the Home Page, the Map Page, the About Page and the More Page.

## The Map Page

In the Map Page, it was expected to have an interactive map of London with boroughs painted in different colours, indicating the danger level based on the latest number of crimes.

When the cursor moved to a borough, there would be a pop-up information box showing some basic information.

## The About Page

The About Page was expected to introduce the purpose of building this website and team members.

## The More Page

This More Page was expected to provide the customised **crime data line chart** functionality. 

Users could select the location they want to explore, and could filter the types of crime and time period to create their own line chart.

***(Note: Only the borough-level crime data has been realised by the end of the submission deadline. The street-level data will be updated in the future.)***
