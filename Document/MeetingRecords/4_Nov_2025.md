- **Fill Related Query into web (Query.js)**

### Documentation Tasks

- **Project Report**

- **Technical Documentation** - Code comments

- **GitHub Repository** - Proper README and others

- **User Manual** - Guide for website usage

### Report

Each group must write a report about the design, development, and execution of the project.&#x20;

**Included in the report there should be a link to your website and a link to your GitHub Repository**

The reports should include:

1.  a case of where the project fits in the wider context of research (with relevant references given)&#x20;

2.  data visualisation available on the web.&#x20;

3.  how the entire website was put together, including the collection and handling of data, user experience journey through storyboarding and wireframes design (UX), development of site,&#x20;

4.  design of the data visualisation, interactivity and API, databases used within the project.&#x20;

5.  A conclusion should detail how, if given more time, they would improve the project.

### Review

**Group Website – 60%**

The website should be interactive and pull data from a database linked to a server side component (through an API, MQTT or related technology). Analysis results may be pre-processed and results recorded in the database, then visualised on the website in the form of graphs, maps etc. You are expected to demonstrate the full extent of knowledge of frontend and backend website design and interactive visualisation skills you have been taught during this module
