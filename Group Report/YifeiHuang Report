Project Context and Aims: SafeCity London

This project uses the principles of information visualization and urban computing to transform technical crime data into a user-friendly user interface, allowing the public to perform personalised security analyses and make life decisions.

SafeCity London just looks like a civic technology effort that is designed to democratize access to crime data via what appear to be intuitive interactive visualizations and analytical tools. What apparently emerges from these commentaries is that the impetus for the project appears to derive primarily from a greatly increased societal demand for transparency in public safety information which, it seems, is being generally sought to empower both residents and also visitors to London in arriving at what seem to be more evidence-based decisions about their personal security and urban mobility. What appears particularly significant about these findings is the underlying intention to bridge what seems to be a continued information gap.
 
What the data seems to indicate is that this initiative is located within the wider analytic framework of the UK open data initiative, especially since the launch of the Police.uk face in 2011. What that seems to have provided is unprecedented access to streets crimes apparently to the general public 【1】. While this government initiative would appear to have represented a milestone in the promotion of transparency, the datasets themselves would seem to be extremely technical and often beyond the comprehension of the lay public, which is perhaps significant in this analytic context. What the analysis seems to show is that SafeCity London seems to meet directly this need or gap in accessibility by converting these complex and often unstructured datasets into visually comprehensible and user-friendly interfaces. By doing so, it would seem to indicate an empowerment of the individual without the background of direct data analysis to engage meaningfully with information with regard to public safety, and which would seem to meritoriously deserve further analytic consideration.
 
What is emergent as theoretically significant in this area is what may be called the project’s apparent theoretical grounding in principles of information visualization and urban informatics, appearing to derive from Edward Tufte’s principles of analytical design 【2】 and Tamara Munzner’s frameworks of visual analytics 【3】. Within these evolving conceptual parameters, as part of the expanding civic technology ecosystem, SafeCity London seems to follow in the tracks of such platforms as CrimeMapping.com. What this seems to indicate, however, is what is an apparent distinction in that it concentrates predominantly on London’s unique borough geography, its demographic diversity, and what seem to be density-related safety problems. From the subtle nature of these findings, what this study appears to indicate is that SafeCity London seems to be pursuing what appear to be three principal aims:
 
1.To present what looks like an intuitive map of the boroughs, color-coded, with implied crime rates in context of population density, which seems intended from a more balanced viewpoint of safety over the different parts of the town.
 
2.To allow exploratory analysis the apparent capability of the platform for dynamic time-based visualizations, generally indicates what seems to point to time series trends and seasonal variations in criminal phenomena. 

3.This also appears indicative of the potential for individualized safety planning, permitting users to presumably personalize data views by locality, criminal category and period, given the complexity of these hypothetical relationships.
 
Storyboarding: Real-World Use Cases
What the statistics seem to indicate is that SafeCity London appears to be created to sensibly deal with everyday situations where awareness of safety appears to influence decision making with what seems to be an appropriate use of the tools available. Below are some of the stories which appear to give several different illustrations of how the platform may work, bearing in mind the subtleties of the information, and at the same time strata of effective analysis to be considered in this wider framework:
 
Our story begins with what appears to be a simple phone call — an offer of a trip. But what appears remarkable about these findings is that, normally, every traveller appears to know this: it is feasible to travel safely. When what is called doubt appears to set in, she goes to our company web site. What the site appears capable of effecting, with what appears to be one search, is that possible dangers appear to be become generally apparent. Red zones? It is presumably better not to go. Green zones? What appear to be confirmed safe zones. What do these phenomena seem to indicate, therefore, is that she can go forth fearlessly — because what appears to be true free will emerges from the generally knowing she is safe, what tends to become in this connection theoretically important.
 
There are other cases that show how SafeCity London helps different populations: people preparing to rent find safe and affordable housing by comparing flight and disruption data in each region; By analyzing seasonal variations in drug crime and police problems, community workers can legitimately ask police to increase their patrols during periods of high frequency; Motorists choose guarded parking areas by looking at data on bicycle theft and knowing which months they need to be particularly vigilant. These examples illustrate the success of this platform in turning complex crime data into a practical guide that helps people make more informed safety choices in their lives.

It appears that the SafeCity London user experience is built on a carefully-layered technical and interaction design basis. The site also appears to have a hybrid styling approach which makes use of a custom CSS architecture combined with the market-leading icon set, Font Awesome 6.4.0 delivered via the Cloudflare CDN【1】 which broadly indicates that the visual language for the entire platform is modern, cohesive and scalable.

What is also relevant in this regard is that this visual foundation seems to be activated by what might be described as careful interactivity, across the platform exhibited in subtler effects for the hover states that are typically indicated. It is on pages such as that of 'About' where through the inter activity of such as the team cards and boxes of features the general response of the elements to the position of the cursor generally produces a gentle lift upward and a soft external shadow. What seems especially relevant to these findings is that it is the micro-interactions themselves that seem to tend to produce instant tactile feedback—thus in large part converting the interface from static to dynamically altering, producing what seems an enhanced general quality of responsiveness and life on the application.

By considered feedback, and given the necessarily subtle nature of the results, it appears that generally, the user experience journey is intuitively guided by navigational cues. What this evidence suggests is an apparently clear instance of the strategic positioning particularly with regard to the placement, of a "Back to Map" tab at the end of information pages. This would appear to imply an anticipation of what would appear to be the logical follow-on to looking at issues that arise from the information about the project, which logically goes on to actively exploring the crime information itself, and thus appears to create a continuously flowing process from insight to action. What would appear to result from this position, therefore, is that these design choices, considered as a whole, it would seem, from the basic visual schema, to the minutiae of the interactivity, it would appear, work smoothly in tandem to create an interactive experience which is technically able to fulfill the purposes of information and clarity, but appears to have an attractive and intuitive navigational style.
